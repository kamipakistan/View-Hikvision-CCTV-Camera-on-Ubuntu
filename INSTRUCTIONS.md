## Step 6: Open Your IP Camera
Access your Hikvision CCTV IP camera by entering its IP address in a web browser.

## Step 7: Login to Hikvision Website
After the website loads, a login window will appear. Enter the complete `IP address` of your camera in the web browser opened in `Step 4`. Then, insert your camera's `username` and `password` in the login window.

## Step 8: Download Plugin
Download the required plugin and place it in the `FirefoxPortableESR/Data/Plugins` directory.
